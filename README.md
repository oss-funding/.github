# Open Source Sponsorships by Livepeer and OSS Funding SPE

Livepeer relies heavily on open-source software. These projects, maintained by dedicated developers, are essential for Livepeer's video transcoding network and emerging AI capabilities. While freely available, maintaining these projects requires significant developer time and effort. Thus, to contribute our part to supporting open-source software, we at [Livepeer](https://www.livepeer.org/) and [OSS Funding SPE](https://explorer.livepeer.org/treasury/39549981365616941647238744664851111817074961843443607299795325625311288410936) are excited to sponsor the following projects.
